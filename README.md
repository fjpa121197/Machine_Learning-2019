The different files just differ from the type of imputation method for attribute F20, F20K uses K-nearest neighbour, F20M uses mean value, noF20 doesnt use that attribute. FeatureSelection file uses a method to decide which attributes do not give information based on missing threshold, correlation, importance. This file was the one used for the final prediction file.
